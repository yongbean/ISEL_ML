# Machine Learning Algorithm Collection

In this repository, I have coded multiple regression / classification algorithms such as,
- Linear Regression
- Multi-Featured Linear Regression
- Binary Logistic (Regression) Classification
- Multinomial Logistic (Regression) Classification (multi-labelled Y)

By implementing Apache Commons CLI, We can run the runner.java file to perform each algorithms

the command is listed below:
-t <train.csv file> -p <test.csv file> -m <model>

for model, as implemented algorithms:
- -m
- "single"
  - single featured linear regression
- "multi"
  - multi-featured linear regression
- "logistic"
  - logistic regression (single or multi-features)
- "softmax"
  - multinomial logistic regression (classifying data into multi-label types)

# Machine Learning Algorithm Collection

In this repository, I have coded multiple regression / classification algorithms such as,
- Linear Regression
- Multi-Featured Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

By implementing Apache Commons CLI, We can run the runner.java file to perform each algorithms

the command is listed below:
-t <train.csv file> -p <test.csv file> -m <model>

for model, as implemented algorithms:
- "single" = single featured linear regression
- "multi" = multi-featured linear regression
- "logistic" = logistic regression (single or multi-features)
